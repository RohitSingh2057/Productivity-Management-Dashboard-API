# Productivity-Management-Dashboard-API
The Productivity Management Dashboard API is a backend web application built using Django and Django REST Framework. It provides a secure and scalable system for managing tasks while offering productivity insights based on user activity.

The API uses JWT-based authentication to ensure secure user access. Each user can create, update, and manage their own tasks with customizable parameters such as priority, deadlines, and completion status.

This project represents my first complete Django application, where I applied both newly learned Django concepts and my prior knowledge of SQL and relational databases to design and manage a robust data layer.

Key Features:
Create, update, and delete tasks
Mark tasks as complete, pending or in progress
Designed to integrate seamlessly with frontend applications
Persistent data storage using a relational database
Secure backend logic handled through Django’s ORM

Going forward I would like to include:
Implement Filtering and searching for users using Filterview
Implement more analytics for daily, weekly tasks (Number of task based on each parameter, Completion rate)
Enhance frontend, dashboard
Add subtasks,reminders and notifications
